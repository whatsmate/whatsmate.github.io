This article shows you how to send an image to a WhatsApp group in Node.js (JavaScript).


To send an image in to a WhatsApp group in `Node.js`, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-group-message-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/wa-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `nodejs/send-image-group.js`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/f647fb99062acfda0e3c5fe752196891.js"></script>
4. Study the `Node.js` source code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, you must name your group *creatively*. Otherwise, the group may not receive the message.
5. Change to the directory containing the script: `cd nodejs`
6. Run the script to send your group the first image: `./send-image-group.js`


Happy coding :)
