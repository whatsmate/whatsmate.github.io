This article shows you how to send an image to a WhatsApp group in Java.


To send an image to a WhatsApp group in Java, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message to a group on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-group-message-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/wa-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `Java/WaImageGroupSender.java`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/1db305f0858a8053ab647e0612713385.js"></script>
4. Study the Java source code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, you must name your group *creatively*. Otherwise, the group may not receive the message.
5. Change to the directory containing the script: `cd Java`
6. Follow the instructions at the top of the source code to compile and run the Java program.


Happy coding :)
