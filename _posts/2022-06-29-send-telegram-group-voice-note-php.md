This article shows you how to send a voice note file (e.g. an OPUS file) to a registered Telegram group in PHP.



To send a Telegram message containing a voice note file in PHP, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message to a group on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/telegram-group-message-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/telegram-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `php/group-send-telegram-opus.php`. <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/8f92150c47b370d3140c78fd75cdba87.js"></script>
4. Study the PHP source code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
5. Visit the PHP page you just created to send your OPUS file to your group.


Happy coding :)
