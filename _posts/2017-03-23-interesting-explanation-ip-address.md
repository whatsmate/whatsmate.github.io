I came across an interesting article that explains what an IP address is in such a way that even a 12-year-old would understand it.


I always thought that IP addresses and most Internet/computer concepts are all about bits and bytes. It never occurred to me that
concepts can be explained in such a down-to-earth and easy-to-understand way! [The article](http://www.ip-address-pigeon.com/en/what-is-an-IP-address) is so inspiring!


You probably already know what an IP address is. But if you have time, check out the article to see an old thing with a pair of new eyes.
The URL is [http://www.ip-address-pigeon.com/en/what-is-an-IP-address](http://www.ip-address-pigeon.com/en/what-is-an-IP-address).
