This article shows you how to send an image to a WhatsApp group in Python 3.


To send an image to a WhatsApp group in Python 3, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-group-message-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/wa-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `python3/send-image-group.py`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/37afb33639bcf676cf9b144b65b9331b.js"></script>
4. Study the Python source code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, you must name your group *creatively*. Otherwise, the group may not receive the message.
5. Change to the directory containing the script: `cd python3`
6. Run the Python script to send yourself the first image: `./send-image-group.py`


Happy coding :)
