This article shows you how to send an image to a WhatsApp group in VBA / Visual Basic Script.


To send an image to a WhatsApp group in VBA, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message to a group on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-group-message-api.html).
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/wa-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `vba/SendImageToGroup.vbs`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/e39d3a82a2b075338cab949498c33635.js"></script>
4. Study the VBA code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, you must name your group *creatively*. Otherwise, the group may not receive the message.
5. Copy the image `assets\cute-girl.jpg` in the sample code package to `C:\Users\Public\cute-girl.jpg`
6. Run `Main_Routine` in the VBA program to send your group the first image!


Happy coding :)
