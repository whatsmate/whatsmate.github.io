This article shows you how to send a WhatsApp message from PHP.

Before the recipient can receive your WhatsApp message, she will need to register with the WhatsMate WA Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway-api.html). *Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*
