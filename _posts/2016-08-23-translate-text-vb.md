This article shows you how to translate textual natural languages in Microsoft's .net language: VB.


To translate text (e.g. from English to Japanese) in VB.NET, do this:

1. Copy the following source code to the main module file in your Console Application in Visual Studio.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/87ab01d11a0e3184043bb558721046d8.js"></script>
2. Specify your translation requirements on lines 64 through 67. 
3. Add the reference "System.Web.Extensions" by doing this:
   1. Right-click on your project node in the Solution Explorer panel.
   2. Choose "Add" -> "Reference..."
   3. Choose "Framework" on the left pane.
   4. Look for "System.Web.Extensions" in the middle pane. Check the checkbox in front of it.
   5. Click OK.
4. Build and run the application in Visual Studio.
