This article shows you how to send an image to a registered Telegram user from a shell script.

Before the recipient can receive your Telegram message, she MUST register with the WhatsMate Telegram Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/telegram-gateway-api.html). <span style="color:red">*Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*</span>

To send a Telegram message containing an image from a shell script, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/telegram-gateway-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/telegram-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `bash/send-telegram-image.sh`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/806e319ac49a980045bb3e2d4c6da050.js"></script>
4. Study the script and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, put down YOUR OWN number as the recipient. You can't send messages to strangers because we are against SPAMMERS.
5. Change to the directory containing the script: `cd bash`
6. Run the script to send yourself the first image: `./send-telegram-image.sh`


Happy coding :)
