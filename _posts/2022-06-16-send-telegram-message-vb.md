This article shows you how to send a Telegram message in Microsoft's .net language: VB.NET.

Before the recipient can receive your Telegram message, she will need to register with the WhatsMate Telegram Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/telegram-gateway-api.html). <span style="color:red">*Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*</span>

To send a Telegram message in VB.NET, do this:

1. Copy the following source code to the main module file in your Console Application in Visual Studio.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/72d4e510e19e7d384e52bbab08a1678e.js"></script>
2. Customize the TODO lines:
   * Specify your gateway instance ID on line 10.
