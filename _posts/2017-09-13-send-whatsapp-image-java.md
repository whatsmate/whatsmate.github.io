This article shows you how to send an image to a registered WhatsApp user in Java.

Before the recipient can receive your WhatsApp message, she MUST register with the WhatsMate WA Gateway. Instructions are available on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway-api.html). <span style="color:red">*Unregistered users will never receive messages from the Gateway.*</span>


To send a WhatsApp message containing an image in Java, do this:

1. First, learn how to send a simple text message on the [official site](https://www.whatsmate.net/whatsapp-gateway-api.html). 
2. With the above knowledge, you can now download our [sample code](https://github.com/whatsmate/wa-demos/archive/master.zip).
3. Locate the file `Java/WaImageSender.java`.  <script src="https://gist.github.com/whatsmate/499d731f8eab2caff6a9bd619f20b59f.js"></script>
4. Study the Java source code and customize the TODO/FIXME lines.
   * Among other things, put down YOUR OWN number as the recipient. You can't send messages to strangers because we are against SPAMMERS.
5. Change to the directory containing the script: `cd Java`
6. Follow the instructions at the top of the source code to compile and run the Java program.


Happy coding :)
